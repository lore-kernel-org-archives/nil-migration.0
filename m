Do you really need an atomic-in-between-hots? I mean, it's not really a 
failure if you are in the process of migrating pages onto the switched 
cxl memory memory and one of the pages is pulled out of cxl and back on 
the hypervisor. The running VM cpu can do loads and stores from either. 
So it's running, it's not affected. It's just that your migration is 
potentially "stalled" or "canceled". You only encounter issues when all 
your pages are on cxl and the other hypervisor is pulling pages out.

I think you want to be able to somehow pin the pages on one hypervisor 
and unpin them on the other hypervisor. Or in some other way "pass 
ownership" between the hypervisor. Right? Because of the scenario I 
mention above, if your source hypervisor takes a page out of cxl, then 
your destination hypervisor has a hole in VMs address space and can't 
run it.

That would move us from the shared memory in the CXL 3 spec into the 
sections on direct memory placement I think. Which in order of 
preference is a #2 for me personally and a "backup" plan if #1 shared 
memory doesn't pan out.
