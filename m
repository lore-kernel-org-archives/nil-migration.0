Let me reiterate to make sure I understand your example.
If we focus on VM usecase, your suggestion is to store VM's memory and
associated KVM structures on a CXL.mem device shared by several nodes.  
Even putting aside the aspect of keeping KVM structures on presumably
slower memory, what ZONE_EXMEM will provide that cannot be accomplished
with having the cxl memory in a memoryless node and using that node to
allocate VM metadata?
