I hope it's not something I've said, I'm not claiming VM migration or 
hypervisor clustering is the killer app for CXL. I would never claim 
that. And I'm not one of the CXL folks. You can chuck me into the "CXL 
enthusiasts" bucket.... For a bit of context, I'm one of the 
co-authors/architects of VMware's clustered filesystem[1] and I've 
worked on live VM migration as far back as 2003 on the original ESX 
server. Back in the day, we introduced the concept of VM live migration 
into the x86 data-center parlance with a combination of a process 
monitor and a clustered filesystem. The basic mechanism we put forward 
at the time was: pre-copy, quiesce, post-copy, un-quiesce. And I think 
most hypervisor after which added live migration are using loosely the 
same basic principles, iirc xen introduced LM 4 years later in 2007 and 
KVM about the same time or perhaps a year later. Anyway, the point that 
I am trying to get to is, it bugged me 20 years ago that we quiesced, 
and it bugs me today :) I think 20 years ago, quiescing was an 
acceptable compromise because we couldn't solve it technologically. 
Maybe 20-25 years later, we've reached a point we can solve it 
technologically. I don't know, but the problem interests me enough to try.

We do approximately 2.5 Million live migrations per year. Some 
migrations take less than a second, some take roughly a second, and 
others on very noisy VMs can take several seconds. Whatever that average 
is, let's say 1 second per live migration, that's cumulatively roughly 
28 days of steal lost to migration per year. As you probably know, live 
migrations are essential for de-fragmenting hypervisors/de-stranding 
resources and from my perspective, I'd like to see them happen more 
often with a smaller customer impact.

That is purely virtualization load type dependent. Maybe for the cloud 
you're running devices are a problem(I'm guessing here). For us this is 
a non existent problem. We serve approximately 600,000 customers and 
don't do forms of pass-through so it's literally a non issue. What I am 
starting to tackle with nil-migration is to be able to migrate live and 
executing memory, instead of frozen memory. Which should especially help 
with noisy VMs, and in my experience customers of noisy VMs are more 
likely to notice steal and complain about steal. I understand everyone 
has their own workloads, and the devices problem will be solved in it's 
own right, but it's out of scope for what I am tackling with 
nil-migration. My main focus at this time is memory and context migration.

Chatting with you at the last LPC, and judging by the combined gray hair 
between us, I'll venture to guess we've both fallen off the proverbial 
bike, many times. It's never stopped me from getting back on. Issue 
interest me enough to try.

If you don't mind me asking, what clustering did you work on? Maybe I am 
familiar with it
