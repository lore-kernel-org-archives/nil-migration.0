I'm referencing 3.0 with regards to switched/shared memory as defined in 
Compute Express Link Specification r3.0, v1.0 8/1/22, Page 51, figure 
1-4, black color scheme circle(3) and bars.


It may be possible to do it with 2.0 but as far as I understand[1] the 
2.0 spec it might be a lot more involved/clunky. I think new 3.0 
features make it easier



[1]. I would love to read 2.0 spec, but I don't have access to 2.0 
spec(only 3.0). But that is my understanding from speaking with some CXL 
folks at last years plumbers when I floated this idea with them.
