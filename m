Hmm, do you have any quick thoughts on that?

Right, true. The way I am thinking of it is that this would be a part of 
data-center ops setup which at first pass would be a somewhat of a 
manual setup same way as other pre-OS related setup. But later on down 
the road perhaps this could be automated, either through some pre-agreed 
auto-ranges detection or similar, it's not unusual for dc ops to name 
hypervisors depending of where in dc/rack/etc they sit etc..

Yeah, I get that. But in my experience even heterogeneous setups have 
some level of homogeneity, weather it's per rack, or per pod. As old 
things are sunset and new things are brought in, it gives you these 
segments of homogeneity with more or less advanced features. So at the 
end of the day, if someone wants a feature X they will need to 
understand the feature requirements or limitations. I feel like I deal 
with hardware/feature fragmentation all the time, but doesn't preclude 
bringing newer things in. You just have to plant it appropriately.

That is exactly my thought too.

I definitely see your point, "canning" and "re-hydration" approach as a 
first-pass. I'd be happy with even just a "Hello World" page migration 
as a first pass :)
